# Project Overview

## /components

The `/components` directory serves as a central hub for reusable components and utility functions essential for constructing main pages. These components are designed with modularity and reusability in mind, allowing for efficient development and maintenance of the application.

## /mainpages

The `/mainpages` directory is dedicated to the core components that constitute the main pages of the application. It includes:

- **Dashboard:** The dashboard component provides a centralized view of key metrics and data relevant to the application's primary functionality.

- **Footer:** The footer component is responsible for rendering the footer section of the application. It typically contains information such as copyright notices, links to relevant resources, and other footer-specific content.

- **Navbar:** The navbar component handles the navigation bar of the application. It includes navigation links, menus, or any other elements that facilitate user navigation.

- **Overview:** The overview component is a key section of the application, offering a comprehensive and summarized view. It may include charts, graphs, and other visualizations to present important data at a glance.

Each of these main page components is structured to enhance code maintainability, readability, and ease of extension.

## /resources

The `/resources` directory holds essential resources related to map construction specifically tailored for the overview page. Maps can play a crucial role in visualizing geographical or spatial data, and this directory ensures that relevant assets are organized and easily accessible.
